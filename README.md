# Portfolio of Amethyst White<h1>

## GOAL <h2>
My goal on this project is to demonstrate my skills with building a website from scratch. Using CSS and HTML only I put together a blocked structure resembling a portfolio page
  
## ABOUT ME <h2>
My name is Amethyst White, I am a young woman from Seattle, WA. I am new to computer coding and I am trying to make a career change to better my future. I love art, food and whiskey. Constructive criticism welcome.

## Thought Process <h2>

**HTML** 
* I started this project by placing all the proper sections of the example webpage into <div> categories
* I thought to label each container in order to better organize my future CSS
* I added links
* And spaced all of my containers out within HTML to be more legible

**CSS**
* With the CSS I began at the top, aligning the proper sections and blocks I put into place
* I struggled with placing the links contained in the title for a very long time, eventually realizing I was only missing a closing </div> component
* I made <var> for the colors I would be constantly using
* Placed the titles along the side and aligned the side border
* Struggled for a few hours on making my image grid under the Work category
* Still working on getting the sub-text to appear on all images within the grid
